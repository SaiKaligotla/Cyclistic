## Summary 
  I'm part of Cyclistic's marketing analysis team, where our primary goal is to increase annual memberships for the company's future success. We're examining how casual riders and annual members use bicycles differently to achieve this. Our project aims to gather data-driven insights that will form the basis of a new marketing strategy. This strategy is focused on converting casual riders into annual members, pending approval from Cyclistic's executives. To gain their support, we must back our recommendations with data insights and professional data visualizations.

To answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
