Google Data Analytics: A Case Study in SQL-Data Analysis

_**This is an imaginary project**_

### Characters and teams
#### Cyclistic: 
  A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart
  by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
  and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use
  the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
#### Lily Moreno: 
  The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and
  initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
#### Cyclistic marketing analytics team: 
  A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting
  data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategies. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about
  Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
#### Cyclistic executive team: 
  The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
  recommended marketing program

### Summary 
  I'm part of Cyclistic's marketing analysis team, where our main goal is to increase annual memberships for the company's future success. To achieve this, we're          examining how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Our project aims to gather data-driven insights that will form the basis of a new        marketing strategy. This strategy is focused on converting casual riders into annual members, pending approval from Cyclistic's executives. To gain their support, we    must back our recommendations with data insights and professional data visualizations.

To answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.**

### Act : 
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

#### Problem to solve:
_How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?_

  We received cycle trip data for the first quarter of 2020. During the Ask phase, we identified how the data was organized, evaluated its credibility, and sorted and     filtered it for further analysis.

### Prepare :
